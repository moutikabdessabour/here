#' Declare location of current script or report
#'
#' Add a call to `here::i_am("<project-relative path>.<ext>")`
#' at the top of your R script or in the first chunk of your rmarkdown document.
#' This ensures that the project root is set up correctly:
#' subsequent calls to `here()` will refer to the implied project root.
#' If the current working directory is outside of the project
#' where the script or report is intended to run, it will fail
#' with a descriptive message.
#'
#' Relying on the project root determined with a project file,
#' the default for versions prior to 1.0.0,
#' only weakly protects against running a script from an arbitrary directory
#' outside the intended project.
#' The `i_am()` function offers a stronger way to define the project root:
#' it will ensure that the project root actually contains a file in that location,
#' optionally checking for file contents that uniquely identify the file
#' via the `nonce` argument.
#'
#' This function will fail if the script or report is moved within the project.
#' Update the `i_am()` call to reflect the new location.
#' If you use the `nonce` argument for extra safety, be sure to change it
#' when you save an existing script or report under a new name.
#'
#' @param path `[character(1)]`\cr
#'   The path to the current script or report, relative to the project root.
#'   Passing an absolute path raises an error.
#' @param ... Must be empty, reserved for future use.
#' @param uuid `[character(1)]`\cr
#'   `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#'   If not `NULL`, a unique string that is matched
#'   against the first 100 lines of the file.
#'   Use [uuid::UUIDgenerate()] to create a unique string
#'   that can be used as a `uuid` argument.
#'
#' @return This function is called for its side effects.
